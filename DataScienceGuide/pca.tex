\subsection{Principal Components Analysis}

Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is one of the most common ways of reducing dimension of a dataset. The main algorithm is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Standardize dataset that we want to perform PCA on. This entails subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.

\item Get covariance matrix of dataset.

\item Do eigen value decomposition on covariance matrix.

\end{enumerate}


If we have our data matrix $X$ which is $n$x$p$ ($n$ number of instances, $p$ number of features), then our correlation matrix is given by:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{n}X_s^TX_s
\end{equation}

\noindent where $X_s$ is the standardized matrix (subtract the mean and divide by standard deviation for each feature).
