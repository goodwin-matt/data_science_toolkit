# Data Science Toolkit

This is a collection of data science notes, code, flash cards, etc. that I've compiled for future reference, interview prep, etc.

## DataScienceCode

Collection of jupyter notebooks and other misc. items with code I'd like to keep handy.

## DataScienceGuide

Latex notes of key data science topics.

## Anki Process 

Flashcards from Anki for help studying and staying fresh with all things data science. I use the Anki app and sync my changes on that platform but this is an extra precaution.

### Creating a card

1. Add on computer in Anki
2. Sync with AnkiWeb
3. Export all decks to this repo in txt file form by clicking the export button and specifying exporting all decks
4. Export all decks to this reop in .apkg form 
5. Copy over the collection.media folder (contains all images) with the following command:
```bash
make copy_media
```
6. Add, commit, and push up changes

Images for use in the app are automatically saved here:

``` ~/Library/Application\ Support/Anki2/User\ 1/collection.media```
