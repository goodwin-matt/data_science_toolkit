# Data Science Interview Guide

I've compiled a high level list of topics to study for interviews below. Includes technical, non-technical topics, 
questions to ask, etc.

Unfortunately, when it comes to interviews, a lot of what you learn in your day-to-day job may not transfer to your 
interviewing ability. I’ve listed below the essential topics I'd like to stay current on for data science interviews, 
broken up into 
sections. Maybe another way to look at it is these are the core things a data scientist should know, 
even though they don’t use these concepts or directly think about them during a given day. 

The other thing to keep in mind is to be able to do this without feeling overwhelmed. 
There is so much to learn and remember and it takes patience to cover everything here.

(Note this is a living document, I'll keep modifying this list)


## Technical Topics

####TODO/Ideas for study: 

Write down detailed steps of each model I know - not just the theoretical steps but also the 
implementation details, parameters, how to improve, etc.

Look through data science study guides and review what I need to learn

Learn Spark and its args

Go through Supervised learning models and make sure I’ve got a good elevator pitch for each one

Write up own probability cheat sheet for how to solve probability and counting problems

Clean up SQL jupyter notebook, make it easier to use for study

Do a hacker rank, or SQL problem once a week

ANKI cards

One probability question a week
